    PURPOSE: Given an array, return a ctypes structure containing the
             arrays info (data, shape, strides, ndim). A check is made to ensure
             that the array has the specified dtype and requirements.
             
    INPUT: a: an array: something that is or can be converted to a numpy array
           dtype: the required dtype of the array, convert if it doesn't match
           ndim: integer: the required number of axes of the array

    OUTPUT: ctypes structure with the fields:
             . data: pointer to the data : the type is determined with the dtype of the
                     array, and with ctypesDict.
